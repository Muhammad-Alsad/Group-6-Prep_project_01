# Conflict Plan

First, encourage open communication and active listening to ensure everyone's perspectives and concerns are heard.
If the conflict cannot be resolved informally, the team will schedule a meeting to discuss the issue and attempt to find a solution that works for everyone.
If necessary, a mediator can be brought in to facilitate the discussion and ensure everyone is heard and respected.
In extreme cases where the conflict cannot be resolved, the team can escalate the issue to the project manager or supervisor.
If one person is taking over the project:

The team will schedule a meeting to discuss the issue and encourage the person to listen to other team members' input and ideas.
If the issue persists, the team will escalate the issue to the project Instructor.
Approaching challenges and skill levels:

The team will work collaboratively to identify and address knowledge gaps and skill disparities, with a focus on skill sharing and peer learning.
Encourage team members to ask for help or clarification when needed and provide support and guidance to each other.
Raising concerns about inadequate contributions:

The team will schedule a meeting to discuss the issue and encourage the person to contribute more actively and proactively.
If the issue persists, the team can assign specific tasks and deadlines to ensure everyone is contributing equally.
Escalating conflicts:

# Communication Plan

Hours of availability:

The team will be available to communicate during the day after iftar time, as this is during Ramadan.
We will also schedule a daily meeting on Discord to discuss progress and any issues that arise.
Platforms for communication:

The team will primarily use Discord for communication, as it allows for both voice and text chat.
If needed, we may also use slack or phone calls for urgent matters.
Breaks:

The team will take breaks as needed, with the understanding that Ramadan fasting may affect energy levels and productivity.
Plan for falling behind:

If a team member falls behind, they will communicate their progress and seek assistance from other team members to catch up.
Communication after hours and on the weekend:

The team will primarily communicate during scheduled work hours, but urgent matters can be communicated via Discord, email, or phone.
Ensuring everyone's voice is heard:

We will make sure to have an open communication culture and encourage everyone to speak up during meetings and in Discord chats.
We will also assign roles and tasks based on individual strengths and preferences to ensure everyone has a chance to contribute.
Creating a safe environment:

We will establish clear communication guidelines and encourage respectful communication.
We will make sure everyone has an opportunity to speak and ask for feedback during meetings and team discussions.

-----------------------------------------------------

# Work Plan

To ensure that everyone is contributing equally and working on substantial tasks, we will follow these steps:

Identify tasks:
We will break down the project into small, manageable tasks, such as setting up the back-end, creating the front-end components, implementing user authentication, etc.
Each task will be assigned a priority level and a due date.

Assign tasks:
We will assign tasks based on each team member's strengths and interests, as well as workload balance.
We will make sure that everyone has a mix of front-end and back-end tasks, and that no one is working on a task in isolation.
We will give Friday ,Saturday and Sunday to the back-end and deployment tasks, which leaves us 3 days for front-end and styling tasks.

Know when tasks are complete:
We will use a project management tool (like "trello") to track the progress of each task, and to know when it is complete . 
Team members will update the status of their tasks regularly, and communicate any issues or delays.

Manage work in general:
We will have regular check-ins as a team to discuss progress, address any issues, and plan for the next steps.
We will encourage open communication and transparency about workload and progress.
We will take breaks every 2-3 hours to avoid burnout and maintain productivity.

Project management tool:
We will use Trello as our project management tool, which will allow us to assign tasks, set due dates, track progress, and communicate with each other.

# Git Process

What components of your project will live on GitHub?
All components of the project will be on GitHub, including the codebase, documentation, and any other relevant files.

How will you share the repository with your teammates?
We will share the repository by adding each team member as an owner and granting .

What is your Git flow?
We will be using the Git feature branch workflow, where each team member will create a new branch for each feature they are working on. Once the feature is complete, they will submit a pull request to the main branch. The pull request will be reviewed by at least two team members, and once approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

How many people must review a PR?
At least two team members must review a pull request before it can be merged into the main branch.

Who merges PRs?
The team lead will be responsible for merging pull requests.

How often will you merge?
Pull requests will be merged on a daily basis or as soon as they are ready, as long as they have been reviewed and approved.

How will you communicate that it's time to merge?
We will communicate through discord/slack to indicate that a pull request is ready for review and merging. The team leader will also be responsible for checking in regularly to ensure that pull requests are not left waiting for too long.
